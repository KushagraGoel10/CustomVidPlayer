This is a custom video player in React, without any 3rd party library.

The final custom component is in ChunkedVideoPlayer(props).jsx in which i have created a component with 2 props, video url and chunkSize. 
Here, video url is simple, the link of your video & 2nd prop chunkSize which is nothing but the chunk percentage. for eg- if chunkSize is 10 then there will be 10 parts of the video divided equally and for the starting, only 0-10% will be loaded and then so on.

For code-> 
Component is ChunkedVideoPlayer(props).jsx, and

App2.jsx for our app.
